# Mobile Responsiveness Fixes

## Tasks
- [ ] Update venue_card.html for responsive image heights
- [ ] Update home.html for responsive card layouts and dimensions
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness by running the server and checking on mobile view

## Details
- Venue cards: Change fixed h-48 to responsive heights (e.g., h-48 sm:h-56 lg:h-48)
- Home page cards: Make the three cards stack vertically on mobile and adjust widths/heights responsively
- Ensure proper spacing and layout on small screens
